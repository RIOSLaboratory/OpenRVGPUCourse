# **RISC-V** **based Open-Source GPU Architecture and Design Exploration**



This course focuses on the popular interdisciplinary frontiers of RISC-V open-source architecture and GPU design, constructing an exploratory knowledge system spanning from instruction sets to many-core computing architectures, enabling learners to enter the RISC-V GPU architecture domain via the shortest path, and exploring the application potential of technologies such as 2.5D/3D/3.5D Chiplet and open-source EDA in open-source GPUs.
